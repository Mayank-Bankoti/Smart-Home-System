# Smart-Home-System
In this project I am automating different tasks using STM32 microcontroller
In this project I have implemented password based door lock system, If a person enter correct password than only door opens.
For security purpose if the person enters in a room the buzzer will beep
also there is system of automatically opening and closing of fan based on temperature measured by sensor.
